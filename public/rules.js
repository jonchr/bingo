"You may not inform Jared about the game until the game or day is over.",
"You may try to manipulate his actions, however, do so without arousing suspicion.",
"Each player will have their own randomized board. Refreshing the page will not give you a new board.",
"All events are universal to everyone (i.e. if one person can mark something, everyone else can).",
"It is good sportsmanship (but not required) to notify others of an event, especially to confirm subjective ones.",
"If necessary, Jake, Alex, and/or Jon will judge the validity of a situation.",
"Upon winning, slack the (custom) student channel to announce your victory.",
"The victor gets to tell Jared about the game, have someone else tell Jared, or decide what to do next."
